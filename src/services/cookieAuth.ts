/**
 * Option C — native cookie jar.
 *
 * The backend issues the session as an httpOnly `Set-Cookie: b2b_session`
 * header and never returns a token in a response body (confirmed against
 * both the backend source and the live OpenAPI spec — see
 * conflicts-and-risks.md R-1). `httpOnly` blocks a browser's
 * `document.cookie`, but it does NOT block native OS cookie-store APIs
 * (NSHTTPCookieStorage / Android CookieManager) — those operate below the
 * browser-JS layer entirely, which is what makes this approach viable.
 *
 * We do not rely on RN's networking layer to attach cookies to outgoing
 * requests implicitly (behaviour that varies across RN/OkHttp versions and
 * was flagged as a reliability risk during planning). Instead this module
 * is the single explicit source of truth: httpClient reads the cookie
 * here and sets the `Cookie` header itself on every request. RN's fetch,
 * unlike a browser's, does not forbid manually setting the `Cookie`
 * header — that restriction is browser-only.
 */

/**
 * Every call below goes through one FIFO queue.
 *
 * `CookieManager` is a single native module: a read (`getCookieHeader`)
 * and a wipe (`clearAll`) issued concurrently race on the same underlying
 * cookie store, and on a sign-out immediately followed by a sign-in that is
 * exactly what happens — the outgoing `POST /auth/credentials` builds its
 * Cookie header while sign-out's `clearAll` is still in flight. Depending
 * on which lands first the request either carries a dead session cookie or
 * stalls on the bridge, so `credentialsAccepted` never dispatches and the
 * user is left staring at the Login screen with no OTP step. Serialising
 * removes the race outright: a header build started after a clear always
 * sees the cleared jar, and never overlaps it.

 * empty. The two are genuinely separate jars on iOS. This app has no
 * WKWebView and never calls `CookieManager.set()`/`setFromResponse()`
 * itself — the session cookie only ever gets into a store because native
 * `fetch()` (URLSession) auto-persists the backend's `Set-Cookie` response
 * header, and URLSession's default configuration writes to the FOUNDATION
 * store, not WebKit's. Reading webkit-only was therefore finding an empty
 * jar every time (not intermittently) even though the session was
 * genuinely valid — REST calls kept working because they go through
 * `fetch()` directly rather than through this read path. Trying both,
 * webkit first, keeps this working if a future WKWebView-based flow (e.g.
 * an OAuth connector) ever writes the cookie into that store instead.

 * (httpClient.ts's `if (cookieHeader) headers['Cookie'] = ...`) and lets
 * `fetch()`'s own implicit attachment from the Foundation store carry the
